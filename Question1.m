% Determining the square root of a number p is the same as finding the root of the equation f(x) = x^2 - p = 0.

% Write a MATLAB user defined function that determines the square root of a positive number by solving this equation using the NewtonRaphson Method.
% Name the function Xs = SquareRoot(p).
% The output argument Xs is the answer and p is the number whose square root is to be determined.
% The starting value for x should be x = p
% and the iterations should stop when the estimated relative error is less than 0.00001. 
% The maximum number of iterations should be 20.
% After 5 iterations the program calculates the square root of 729 to be (rounded to two decimal places):
